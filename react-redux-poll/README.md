# Problem:

For this exercise we would like you to use a basic React template with defined mock data to implement a simple interface.

The mock data contains a JSON array of multiple choice questions, possible answers, and the number of times each answer was selected by other users. Please modify the JavaScript to parse the mock JSON that is already defined, pick one of the questions at random, and display the question prompt with the potential answers as a form with radio buttons.

When this form is submitted, you should render additional text at the top of the page that says "You selected: the text for the answer they selected" and below that, the other potential answers each with the number of times each was selected by other users next to it (which is found the "responses" attribute in the JSON).
